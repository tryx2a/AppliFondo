   *       FDUMP is intended to be replaced by a locally written 
   *       version which produces a symbolic dump.  Failing this, 
   *       it should be replaced by a version which prints the 
   *       subprogram nesting list.  Note that this dump must be 
   *       printed on each of up to five files, as indicated by the 
   *       XGETUA routine.  See XSETUA and XGETUA for details.
