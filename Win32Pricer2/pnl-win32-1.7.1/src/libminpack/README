The Minpack routines used here come from the  C/C++ Minpack 
version available at http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/cminpack.html 

All these routines have been slightly modified by Jérôme Lelong
<jerome.lelong@gmail.com> to compile without the f2c library. For a
better integration into Pnl, all minpack routines have been prefixed
by pnl_minpack.


====== C language readme for minpack ======

This is a C version of the minpack minimization package.
It has been derived from the fortran code using f2c and
some limited manual editing. Note that you need to link
against libf2c to use this version of minpack. Extern "C"
linkage permits the package routines to be called from C++.
Check ftp://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/f2c for the latest
f2c version. For general minpack info and test programs, see
the accompanying readme.txt and http://www.netlib.org/minpack/.

This software has been tested on a RedHat 7.3 Linux machine -
usual 'use at your own risk' warnings apply.

Repackaging by Frederic Devernay -- frederic dot devernay at m4x dot org:
- Added fortran and C examples
- Added documentation from Debian man pages
- Wrote pure C version
- Added covar() and covar_(), and use it in tlmdef/tlmdif


========== Original Fortran Minpack ==============

Minpack includes software for solving nonlinear equations and
nonlinear least squares problems.  Five algorithmic paths each include
a core subroutine and an easy-to-use driver.  The algorithms proceed
either from an analytic specification of the Jacobian matrix or
directly from the problem functions.  The paths include facilities for
systems of equations with a banded Jacobian matrix, for least squares
problems with a large amount of data, and for checking the consistency
of the Jacobian matrix with the functions.

This directory contains the double-precision versions.
