All the files starting in quadpack_ originates from QuadPack, a
Fortran library for numerical integration available from Netlib. The
Fortran code has been translated using f2c and a few more
modifications have been made by Jerome Lelong for a better integration
in Pnl. In particular, most quadpack routines have been prefixed by
pnl_ to avoid name clashes.


For the moment, all the qegX mathods iand the qng method have been
interfaced.  Do we need to interface the qawX methods? Their code is
in there and already compiled but we need to write a wrapper.
