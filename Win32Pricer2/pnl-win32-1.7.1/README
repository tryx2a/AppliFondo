1/ Availability 

The current stable release of PNL is always available from
https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/pnl/.

The development version can also be downloaded using subversion from the
Gforge repository

svn checkout --username anonsvn https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/pnl
password is anonsvn

2/ Compilation and installation

    See the INSTALLATION file

    If you got the sources from the svn repository, you need to compile the
    documentation yourself: 
      Go to directory man and 
        - for the pdf version, run make (you need a LaTeX compiler). 
        - for the html version, run make html (you need tex4ht). 

3/ Using the library under Unix

   You must have installed the library before proceeding to this step. 
   If your want to use the library to develop your own code, here is one
   way of doing it.

   - create a new directory at the top level.

   - Copy the Makefile located in perso/ to your new directory and
    edit it according to your needs. 
    To define your target just add the executable name, say my-exec, to the BINS
    list and create an entry
    my_exec_OBJS 
    carrying the list of .o files needed to create your executable.
    Note that the '-' in executable names are replaced by '_' to create the
    corresponding _OBJS variable
